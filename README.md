# Bug-Detection-in-IC-fabrication
Changing just a few gates out of several million gates is enough to introduce serious security vulnerabilities into an IC.</br>
It will only be a few secret and carefully chosen inputs for which the vulnerability will be triggered.</br>
In practice, manual testing is not feasible for circuits with more than â‰ˆ 50 inputs.</br>
In this project SAT solvers is used to detect such bugs by carefully choosing test inputs that will expose them.</br>
